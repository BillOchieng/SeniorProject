# AlphaSEEKER

This is my first take on tackling my senior thesis project. Let's get started, shall we?

## Documentation

Plan on using Python with Flask for the web server, pandas for data manipulation, and Plotly for chart visualization.

steps -> plan

- Set up the Flask application
- Create an endpoint to upload the CSV file
- Use pandas to read the CSV file and perform analysis
- Use Plotly to create charts based on the analysis
- Display the charts on the dashboard

### next

- Add error handling (for invalid CSV files, data types, etc.)
- Expand the analysis part to generate specific visualizations or calculations you need.
- Enhance the user interface with better styling, more interactivity, etc.
- Consider security issues, especially if deploying this publicly.
